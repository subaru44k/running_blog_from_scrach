      Your privacy matters. This page explains what data this site collects and how it is used.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">PDF Compressor</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      <li>
        Files are uploaded directly from your browser to Amazon S3 using a short‑lived pre‑signed URL.
      </li>
      <li>
        A serverless process compresses your PDF and stores the result back to S3.
        The original uploaded file (under <code class="px-1 rounded bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800">uploads/</code>)
        is deleted immediately after a successful compression.
      </li>
      <li>
        Download links are short‑lived and expire automatically. S3 lifecycle rules
        also remove residual files after a short retention window.
      </li>
      <li>
        No PDFs are used for analytics or shared with third parties.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-5 mb-2">Site Analytics and Cookies</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      This site aims to minimize tracking. If basic analytics are enabled in the future,
      they will be privacy‑respecting and cookie‑light. Any changes will be reflected here.
