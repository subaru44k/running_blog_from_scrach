      Subaru is Running is a personal site that combines a training blog with a few
      practical tools for everyday use — like the PDF Compressor. The goal is to
      share progress, capture lessons from races and workouts, and offer small utilities
      that are fast, private, and easy to use.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What you'll find here</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      <li>Running logs and race reports, organized by date and category.</li>
      <li>Simple, privacy‑minded tools, starting with PDF compression.</li>
      <li>Lightweight UX designed to work well on desktop and mobile.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How the PDF Compressor works</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">
      Files are uploaded directly to Amazon S3 via a short‑lived, pre‑signed URL.
      A Lambda container (with Ghostscript) compresses the PDF, writes the result back to S3,
      and deletes the original upload. You then receive a short‑lived download link.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
      This design keeps costs low and protects your data by limiting how long files exist on the server.
