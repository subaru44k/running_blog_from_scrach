# Astro Blog Admin

This is a standalone admin UI to manage (list, add, edit, delete) blog posts stored as Markdown files in the Astro blog repository.

## Setup

```bash
cd admin-app
npm install
npm start
```

By default, it connects to the `astro-blog/src/content/blog` folder next door. Make sure you have the Astro blog repo alongside this folder.
